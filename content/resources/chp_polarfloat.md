description: These torpedo-shaped instruments, called polar profiling floats, drift
  nose-up at various depths through the Arctic Ocean while measuring water temperature
  and salinity. The floats are programmed to rise to the surface periodically and
  send data via satellite to scientists on shore. (Photo by Peter Winsor. Courtesy
