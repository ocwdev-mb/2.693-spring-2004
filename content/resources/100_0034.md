description: Echo sounder display of bottom near where the tripod was to be deployed.
  Red is the bottom and the strong scattering signal from the surface while lighter
  colors are fish or bubbles in the water. Suspended sediment may be responsible for
  the lighter color patch above the shallow region at the center of the trace. Photo
