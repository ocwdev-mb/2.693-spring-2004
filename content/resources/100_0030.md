description: MAVS current meter with differential acoustic travel-time sensor using
  the two rings for transducer support. An inductive conductivity cell in orange and
  a stainless steel needle permit salinity and temperature to be measured. Paper towelling
  collects drips from the pressure sensor filled with oil on the end cap. Weichang
